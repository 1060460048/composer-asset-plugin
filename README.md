The Composer Asset Plugin allows you to manage your assets with NPM or Bower package file directly in
the Composer.

> **Warning!**

> Currently the plugin only works in "global" mode, the PR [#3082](https://github.com/composer/composer/pull/3082)
> will work the plugin in "project" mode

This plugin is not intended to circumvent dependency managers, that are NPM or Bower, but to provide a
simple solution to include assets managed by a PHP project with Composer.

It goes without saying that each library javascript must be developed with his usual tools for this
language, that front-end developers know well. However, in the case of a complete project PHP, it is
not necessary to use several tools (php, nodejs, composer, npm, bower, grunt, etc...) to be installed.

It is in this context that this plugin was created: it's not necessary to add an `composer.json`
file and save the library on [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/), in addition to do this for NPM or
Bower. In addition, third party libraries used regularly only supports NPM and/or Bower, and therefore it
is more difficult even impossible to add the Composer file, and this is understandable.

That is why the plugin supports only transposing the package informations of NPM or Bower, to a
compatible version for Composer, allowing a management of dependencies for a project PHP much more readily.

##### Features include:

- Works with native management system versions of VCS repository of composer
- Works with public and private VCS repository
- Lazy loader of asset package file in VCS repository for improve performances
- Gets and creates automatically a Asset VCS repository defined in:
  - [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.org)
  - [Bower Registry](http://bower.io/search)
- Gets and creates automatically the Asset VCS repositories of dependencies defined
  in each asset package (dev dependencies included)
- Mapping conversion of asset package to composer package for:
  - [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/package.json.html) - [package.json](Resources/doc/schema.md#npm-mapping)
  - [Bower Package](http://bower.io/docs/creating-packages) - [bower.json](Resources/doc/schema.md#bower-mapping)
- Conversion of [Semver version](Resources/doc/schema.md#verison-conversion) to the composer version
- Conversion of [Semver range version](Resources/doc/schema.md#range-verison-conversion) to the composer range version
- Conversion of [dependencies with URL](Resources/doc/schema.md#url-range-verison-conversion) to the composer dependencies with the creation of VCS repositories
- Conversion of [multiple versions of the same dependency](Resources/doc/schema.md#multiple-version-of-depdendency-in-the-same-project) to different dependencies of composer
- VCS drivers for:
  - Git
  - GitHub
- Local cache system for:
  - package versions
  - package contents
- Custom asset installers configurable in the root file `composer.json`
- For Bower, all files defined in the section `ignore` will not be installed
- Compatible with commands:
  - `search` (bower only)
  - `show`
  - `licenses`
  - `status`

##### Why this plugin?

Currently, for manage dependencies of javascript asset in a project PHP, we have several possibilities:

1. Install Node.js and use NPM or Bower command line in addition to Composer command line
2. Do the solution 1, but add the Composer scripts to automate the process
3. Include assets directly in the project (really not recommended)
4. Create a repository with all assets and include the `composer.json` file (and use Packagist or an VCS Repository)
5. Adds Package Repository in `composer.json` with the direct download link
6. Creates a Satis or Packagist server
7. Other?

But none of these solutions can't simply manage the javascript assets with their dependencies directly
into Composer. This plugin allows to use the main lists of javascript deposits, but with the possibility
of keeping dependency management in Composer, with the same advantages for the management of versions.
