Fxp Composer Asset Plugin
=========================

The Composer Asset Plugin allows you to manage your assets with NPM or Bower directly in the Composer.

To manage dependencies of javascript asset in PHP, we have several possibilities:

1. Install Node.js and use NPM or Bower command line in addition to Composer command line
2. Do the solution 1, but add the Composer scripts to automate the process
3. Include assets directly in the project (really not recommended)

But none of these solutions can't simply manage the javascript assets with their dependencies directly
into Composer. It is in this context that this plugin was developed, allowing using the main lists of
javascript deposits, but with the possibility of keeping dependency management in Composer, with the
same advantages in the management of versions.

  - [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.org) (public and private repository)
